🧠 How It Works
🔢 Conversion Logic
Non-temperature categories use a base-unit method:

Converted Value
=
(
value
×
from_factor
to_factor
)
Converted Value=( 
to_factor
value×from_factor
​
 )
Temperature conversion uses custom formulas because temperature scales are not linear conversions like others.

🎨 Theme Styling
CSS is injected dynamically based on the selected theme:

Background color

Text color

Card styling

Sidebar look and feel
